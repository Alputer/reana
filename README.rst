About
-----

`REANA <http://reanahub.io/>`_ is a platform for reusable research data
analyses. It permits researchers to structure their analysis data, code,
environment and workflows in reusable manner. REANA command-line client allows
users to instantiate and run computational research data analysis workflows on
remote containerised compute clouds.

REANA was born to target the use case of particle physics analyses, but is
applicable to any scientific discipline. The system paves the way towards
reusing and reinterpreting preserved data analyses even several years after the
original publication.

Features
--------

- help to structure research data analysis in reusable manner
- instantiate computational workflows on remote clouds
- rerun analyses with modified input data, parameters or code
- support for several compute clouds (Kubernetes/OpenStack)
- support for several workflow specifications (CWL, Yadage)
- support for several shared storage systems (Ceph, EOS)
- support for several container technologies (Docker)
