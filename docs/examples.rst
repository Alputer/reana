Examples
========

This page lists several REANA-compatible research data analysis examples that
illustrate how to a typical research data analysis can be packaged in a
REANA-compatible manner to be reusable even several years after original results
were published.

Hello world
-----------

A "hello world" application example that illustrates how a simple command can be
run on the REANA cloud.

Jupyter notebook
----------------

A "world population" research data analysis example that illustrates how to
package an Jupyter Notebook type of analysis with a set of input and output
files.

ROOT and RooFit
---------------

A simplified particle physics analysis example using the `RooFit
<https://root.cern.ch/roofit>`_ package of the `ROOT <https://root.cern.ch/>`_
framework. The example mimics a typical particle physics analysis where the
signal and background data is processed and fitted against a model.
