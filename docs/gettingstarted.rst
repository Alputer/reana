Getting started
===============

Using REANA
-----------

Are you a researcher who would like to run a reusable analysis on REANA cloud?

You can install and use `reana-client <https://reana-client.readthedocs.io/>`_
utility that provides interface to both local and remote REANA cloud
installations. For more information, please see the :ref:`userguide`.

You may also be interested in checking out some existing :ref:`examples`.

Deploying REANA
---------------

Are you an administrator who would you like to deploy and manage REANA cloud?

You can start by deploying REANA locally on your laptop using `reana-cluster
<https://reana-clusterreadthedocs.io/>`_ utility that uses Kubernetes and
Minikube. For more information, please see the :ref:`administratorguide`.

Developing REANA
----------------

Are you a software developer who would like to contribute to REANA?

You may be interested in trying out REANA both from the user point of view and
the administrator point of view first. Follow by reading about
:ref:`architecture` and :ref:`developerguide` afterwards.
